####Questions which review material from Week 1:

1. If a mass m is placed at the end of a spring, and if the mass is pulled downwards and released, the mass-spring system will begin to oscillate. The displacement $y$ of the mass from its resting position is given by a function of the form. 
$$ y(t) = c_1 cos(!t) + c_2 sin(!t); $$
where ! is a constant that depends on the spring and the mass. (See diagram below)

It can be shown that the set of all functions described in Equation (1) (with ! xed and c1; c2 arbitrary real scalars) is a vector space. Don't verify every de ning property of a vector space, but pick any two of the following properties and show that they are satis ed by the set of all functions described in Equation (1).

2.	Consider the set _S_ of polynomials of degree less than or equal to one, with real coefficients, whose constant term is equal to `1': $$S := \{1 + bx : a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}$$ 

    *Prove that under the usual addition of polynomials, S fails to be a vector space over R.* 
    
    *Hint: for any set to be made into a vector space, addition and scalar multiplication must be well-defined. Well-defined addition means that for any two vectors in the set, their sum must also be in the set. Well-defined scalar multiplication means that for any scalar in the field and vector in the set, their product must also be a vector in the set.*
    
    **Answer:** Suppose we have two polynomials, $p(x)= 1 + \gamma_1x$ and $q(x)=1 + \gamma_2x$, such that $$p(x), q(x) \in S: \gamma_1, \gamma_2 \in \mathbb{R},$$ then, by the usual laws of vector addition we get that: $$\begin{aligned} (p + q)(x) &= (1 + \gamma_1x) + (1 + \gamma_2x) \\ &= (1 + 1) + (\gamma_1 + \gamma_2)(x) \\ &= 2 + (\gamma_1 + \gamma_2)(x)  \notin S \end{aligned}$$ Therefore, the set *S* is not closed under vector addition, which implies that it fails to be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$.

3. Consider the subset _T_ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined as follows: $$T := \{(x, y) : x, y \in \mathbb{R} \text{ such that } y = 3x\}$$

    *Prove that T is a subspace of the vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$.*

    *Hint: if V is a vector space and U is a subset of V , then U is a subspace of V provided that:*

    * _U contains the additive identity $(0 \in U)$,_
    * _U is closed under addition $(u, v \in U \implies u + v \in U)$,_
    * _and U is closed under scalar multiplication $(a \in \mathbb{F}$ and $u \in U \implies au \in U)$._
    
    **Answer:** Let $x = 0$. Then we get: $$y = 3x = 3(0) = 0 \implies (0,0) \in T.$$ Therefore, the set *T* contains the additive identity.

###Submitting your assignment (due 5pm Tuesday 2nd August 2016)

*Submit your assignment in hardcopy in your Demonstrator's pigeonhole in the Assignment boxes near the Maths Clinic, on the opposite wall to the Maths Clinic, left of the door to V109. We also ask that you scan your written work and submit it on the MATH2320 UoNline/Blackboard site as a backup and proof of submission, not as a substitute. __Note that we still require the hardcopy submitted in the Assignment Box for your Demonstrator to mark, even if you have submitted a backup on Blackboard.__*
