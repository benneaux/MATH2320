####Questions which review material from Week 1:

1. If a mass m is placed at the end of a spring, and if the mass is pulled downwards and released, the mass-spring system will begin to oscillate. The displacement $y$ of the mass from its resting position is given by a function of the form. 
$$ y(t) = c_1 cos(\omega t) + c_2 sin(\omega t); $$ where $\omega$ is a constant that depends on the spring and the mass. (See diagram below) <center> ![Figure 1: A weighted spring](figures/spring.jpg) </center>

    It can be shown that the set of all functions described in Equation (1) (with $\omega$ fixed and $c_1, c_2$ arbitrary real scalars) is a vector space. Don't verify every defining property of a vector space, but pick any two of the following properties and show that they are satisfied by the set of all functions described in Equation (1).
    * Addition of vectors is associative.
    * Multiplicatio of a vector by a scalar is associative.
    * There exists an additive identity.

2.	Let $U$ and $V$ be subspaces of some vector space $W$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$. Prove that $U \cap V$ is also a subspace of $W$ .

    *Hint: think about what kind of vectors are in $U \cap V$.*

####Introductory level question relating to Week 2:

3.	Consider the list of vectors $B = ((1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1))$ from the vector space $\mathbb{R}^3$.

    (a)	Write the vector $(9, 8, 16)$ as a linear combination of the vectors in $B$.
    (b)	Does the list of vectors $B$ span $\mathbb{R}^3$? Explain why/why not.
    
    **Answer:**

####Extension question - will not be marked, just for interest!

4.	Let $\mathbb{Q}$, with the usual addition and multiplication, be the field of rational numbers. Show that $\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space over the field $\mathbb{Q}$. Is $\mathbb{R}$ a finite-dimensional rational vector space?

###Submitting your assignment (due 5pm Tuesday 9th August 2016)

*Submit your assignment in hardcopy in your Demonstrator's pigeonhole in the Assignment boxes near the Maths Clinic, on the opposite wall to the Maths Clinic, left of the door to V109. We also ask that you scan your written work and submit it on the MATH2320 UoNline/Blackboard site as a backup and proof of submission, not as a substitute. __Note that we still require the hardcopy submitted in the Assignment Box for your Demonstrator to mark, even if you have submitted a backup on Blackboard.__*
