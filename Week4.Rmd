###Questions which review material from Week 2:

1.	Let $P_3(\mathbb{C})$ be the vector space of complex polynomials with degree less than or equal to $3$.
a)	Show that the list of vectors $B =  (x-1, (x-1)^2)$  is linearly independent.
b)	Show that $B$ does not span $P_3(\mathbb{C})$ by giving an example of a vector in $P_3(\mathbb{C})$ that does not belong to the span of $B$.
c)	Denote the vector that you found in the previous part by $p$, and create a new list of vectors $B' = (x-1, (x-1)^2,p)$ . Is $B'$ linearly independent? Is $B'$ a basis for $P_4(\mathbb{C})$? *Why/Why not?*

2. Consider the following subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_4$:$$V_1 = span\left((1,-1,0,0),(1,0,0,-1)\right)	\text{ and }	V_2 = span\left((0,1,0,-1),(0,-1,0,1)\right)$$

a)	What are the dimensions of these subspaces?
b)	Show that $V_1$ spans $V_2$. Hence, what is $V_1 \cap V_2$?
c)	Use the below theorem together with your previous answers to determine dim$(V_1 + V_2)$.

    **Theorem 2.18**: *If $U_1$ and $U_2$ are subspaces of a  nite-dimensional vector space, then* $$\text{dim}(U_1 + U_2) = \text{dim}U_1 + \text{dim}U_2	- \text{dim}(U_1 \cap U_2).$$

###Introductory level question relating to Week 3:
3.	Consider the map $T: \mathbb{R}^2 \implies \mathbb{R}$ given by the rule $T(x,y) = 2x + 3y$.

(a)	Show that $T$ is a linear map.

(b)	Find the null space of $T$ , and sketch this space.

(c)	Is the linear map $T$ injective? *Why/Why not?*

*Hint: Is there a result from the textbook that might help you?*

###Extension question - will not be marked, just for interest!

4. Define a collection of "forward shift" maps $T_\lambda: \mathbb{F}^\infty \implies \mathbb{F}^\infty$ for $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$ by the rule
$$T_\lambda(x_1, x_2, x_3, ...) = ( \lambda, x_1, x_2, ...).$$
For what value(s) of $\lambda$	is $T_\lambda$  a linear map? For these value(s) of	$\lambda$, is $T_\lambda$  injective? surjective?
